Hey! So, how's your hellish day so far?
Splendid! Just tormenting souls all day long to be able to share drinks with you. * ++ * I'll gladly share moments like this with you anytime.
Exhausting! So many souls to torment today. * + * I'm one for hard-working demons like yourself.
Pretty cool! Chilling for most of the day. * - * Not getting your hands dirty today, hm?
I really need to take a vacation. Maybe we could travel together! * -- * A vacation? What's that?

Had some fun bringing souls to our little special hellish place, hm?
Yes! We should torment some souls together at some point! * ++ * You're too nice! That is one of the kindest invitations I've ever received!
Nothing is as rewarding as seeing those souls being tormented! * + * Why, I find my self obliged to agree with you there!
Honestly, I prefer hanging out around here with you! * - * While taking some time to rest is important for the mind, you should always look up to tormenting souls!
I straight up hate my job. * -- * Hm? Then where does your hellish pride resides?

Yo, good timing! My fangs have been itching lately, I DESPERATELY need some relief here!
You should totally bite me! * ++ * ARE YOU SERIOUS!? YOU'RE THE BEST!
You could hunt some humans on the surface! * + * Hey! I like the way you think!
Just bite your own flesh. Problem solved! * - * That's just SO boring!
Aren't there any dentists around here? * -- * Dentists!? HELL NAH!

I can see you can't take your dirty look off of me! What makes you dare to think you could have any of this hotness I constantly exhale, you imp?
I have enough brain cells to see how brilliant and appealing you are! * ++ * Hoh! An imp that isn't completely ignorant, how uncommon!
I could be of many uses! If you catch my drift. * + * Interesting... Very interesting!
Oh, come on. How about you sush so we can hangout and have some drinks? * - * With an insignificant imp like yourself? Ha!
Like I couldn't get you under my foot in a snap of fingers. * -- * Me? Under someone's foot? You joke my patience away, imp.

You know, this bar used to have a pole for dancing, but these imps have removed it.
I wish I could've seen you using it. * ++ * You wouldn't have believed your eyes! There's nobody better than me when it comes to poledancing! Well... there's nobody better than me on anything... Ever. Still!
They removed it? That's such a pointless idea! * + * RIGHT!? How else am I supposed to show my jaw-dropping moves!? Ignorant imps!
Maybe nobody used it well enough? * - * OR MAYBE THEY WERE TOO DAMN BLIND TO SEE MY SUPERIOR MOVES!... DAMN THESE IMPS!
Pole dancing? Pff! That's so silly! * -- * Hoh!? I see! So true talent can't be perceived by worthless imps like yourself. Understandable.

I could REALLY use a good drink right now!
Well, there's enough in my glass for the both of us! * ++ * DAYUM! You're so teasy today!
Speak no more, I'll get you one right away! * + * I owe you one!
We're in a bar, plenty of drinks around! * - * Yeah... You're not wrong.
You should chill for a bit, I can see a huge pile of bottles behind you. * -- * Are you implying I have a drinking problem?

H-Hey! What d-do you think of my outfit?... Hehe!
It's so cute! I love it! * ++ * R-Really!? Thank you!!!
Amazing! It's so fancy! * + * I'm so glad you like it! Hehe!
It looks rad as hell! So cool! * - * Rad? Me?
Maybe it shows just a bit too much? * -- * Eh!?

Oh! I totally saw a triclops raccoon today! They're so cute!
They are cute, alright? But you're much, much cuter! * ++ * EEEH!? Y-You don't mean it!!!
We should vist a demon petting zoo together! * + * AH! I-I WOULD LOVE TO!
Demon raccoons? What the hell are those? * - * Whaaaaat? Have you never seen triclops raccoons!?
The animals around here are kinda odd, don't you think? * -- * NOT AT ALL! I adore all of them! How could you say that!?
