Hey! So, how's your hellish day so far?
Exhausting! So many souls to torment today. * + * I'm one for hard-working demons like yourself.
Pretty cool! Chilling for most of the day. * - * Not getting your hands dirty today, hm?
Splendid! Just tormenting souls all day long to be able to share drinks with you. * ++ * I'll gladly share moments like this with you anytime.
I really need to take a vacation. Maybe we could travel together! * -- * A vacation? What's that?

Had some fun bringing souls to our little special hellish place, hm?
Honestly, I prefer hanging out around here with you! * - * While taking some time to rest is important for the mind, you should always look up to tormenting souls!
Yes! We should torment some souls together at some point! * ++ * You're too nice. That is the kind of invitation I always desire.
I straight up hate my job. * -- * Hm? Then where does your hellish pride resides?
Nothing is as rewarding as seeing those souls being tormented! * + * Why, I find my self obliged to agree with you there!

So, what are your thoughts on Hell?
Honestly, I wish I could leave. * -- * You have no demon pride on you! I'm afraid that's rather disappointing.
I love it! Everything about it. * ++ * I'm glad to hear! You have a hellishly great way of thinking.
The only issue is that I have to work all day long with those souls. * - * You should be more proud of your job.
I'm happy to be anywhere as long as you're nearby! * + * Hmmm? Are you trying something on me, now?

What brings you here today?
I really enjoy this place's mood. * + * So do I. It's quite relaxing, hm?
Just looking for a place to relax after a long day of tormenting souls! * ++ * Ah! A perfect day then?
Trying to run away from responsibilities as much as possible! * -- * Well, that's... Not what I expected to hear.
Well, it's better than staying out there. * - * Hm...

These demons are so loud, I can barely hear the hellish sound of the flames...
The sound of the flames. It's very comforting, I must say. * + * You're one of the very few that also appreciate that. I like that about you.
Come on, don't be such a buzzkill! * -- * I'm not a buzzkill, I just like it when things are quieter.
I like seeing them socializing and having fun! * - * They socialize too much, and work too little.
Maybe we should go to a quieter place together. * ++ * Hmmm. I do appreciate it when you tease me like that.
#I can see you can't take your dirty look off of me! What makes you dare to think you could have any of this hotness I constantly exhale, you imp?
Like I couldn't get you under my foot in a snap of fingers. * -- * Me? Under someone's foot? You joke my patience away, imp.
I have enough brain cells to see how brilliant and appealing you are! * ++ * Hoh! An imp that isn't completely ignorant, how uncommon!
I could be of many uses! If you catch my drift. * + * Interesting... Very interesting!
Oh, come on. How about you sush so we can hangout and have some drinks? * - * With an insignificant imp like yourself? Ha!

You know, this bar used to have a pole for dancing, but these imps have removed it.
I wish I could've seen you using it. * ++ * You wouldn't have believed your eyes! There's nobody better than me when it comes to poledancing!
Maybe nobody used it well enough? * - * OR MAYBE THEY WERE TOO DAMN BLIND TO SEE MY SUPERIOR MOVES!... DAMN THESE IMPS!
They removed it? That's such a pointless idea! * + * RIGHT!? How else am I supposed to show my jaw-dropping moves!? Ignorant imps!
Pole dancing? Pff! That's so silly! * -- * Hoh!? I see! So true talent can't be perceived by worthless imps like yourself. Understandable.

I hate having to hide my body with these clothes! These damn stupid rules made by such incompetent imps!
Your clothes are so fancy though! * - * Anything looks good on me, but nothing's better than showing my body off!
Clothes are such a human thing! No point in wearing them! * + * Hoh!? I didn't expect an imp like you to have such an accurate opinion.
You're already showing enough. * -- * WHAT!? NONSENSE! Only an ignorant imp would say something stupid like that!
You should take them off and prove how wrong these rules are! * ++ * Yeah! Maybe I will!

If I get any drunker, I might as well just go ahead and take my clothes off. I'm way too sweaty.
In that case, I challenge you to a drinking contest! * ++ * Challenge me? Bold move, imp! I accept.
Not sure the others would like to see that. * -- * Are you out of your mind!? All these imps want is to see me without my clothes.
I don't think this is that kind of bar. * - * Nonsense! Any bar I go to turns into that kind of bar.
Alright, I'll go ahead and get you a drink then! * + * I knew you couldn't resist me. Well, nobody can, it's only natural.

Ignorance is the thing that annoys me the most. The issue is that it's the most common trait among these imps.
Well, everyone seems ignorant when compared to you! * + * Not only do they seem ignorant, but they are for a fact! Maybe you're not as ignorant though, little imp...
Damn, you're so edgy! * -- * Edgy!? Oh, please! Nonsense!
Why don't you teach me your ways so I can stop being an ignorant imp? * ++ * Good! You acknowledge your ignorance and inferiority, that's a first. Maybe I will.
What makes you think that? * - * What? Isn't it obvious?... Oh, right... You're one of them.
#Yo, good timing! My fangs have been itching lately, I DESPERATELY need some reliefe here!
Just bite your own flesh. Problem solved! * - * That's just SO boring!
You should totally bite me! *++* ARE YOU SERIOUS!? YOU'RE THE BEST!
You could hunt some humans on the surface! * + * Hey! I like the way you think!
Aren't there any dentists around here? * -- * Dentists!? HELL NAH!

I could REALLY use a good drink right now!
Speak no more, I'll get you one right away! * + * I owe ya one!
We're in a bar, plenty of drinks around! * - * Such a smartass demon, ain't ya?
Well, there's enough in my glass for the both of us! * ++ * Well! If you don't mind it!
You should chill for a bit, I can see a huge pile of bottles behind you. * -- * Are ya implying I have a drinking problem?

I have the impression that Hell's getting hotter by the minute.
Clearly not hot enough! * + * YES!!! I want to feel my skin burning!
I need something to cool me off. * - * Cool off? In Hell?... What?
It's all these flames! Who the Hell keeps setting everything on fire? * -- * You got a problem with that?
Hell's not the only thing getting hotter around here. * ++ * OH! You're such a horny demon, ain't ya?

I have way too much energy right now!
Then why don't you go for a flight or run then? * - * By myself? BORING!
Wanna race me? * + * What? Ya think ya have a chance? HAH! Let's do it!
LET'S SET SOMETHING ON FIRE! * ++ * YEAH! LET'S DO IT!
We could chill in the lava pool! * -- * Chill is the last thing I wanna do!

Dude, I so wanna ride a giant acid scorpion! They're so cool!
They're gonna melt your skin! * - * Well, yeah! That's part of the fun.
Alright, but what about a centiepede leviathan? * ++ * Now, that's a bold idea! I LIKE IT!
We should do it! Let's ride them together! * + * YES! LET'S DO IT!
Or we could adopt your a pet three-headed horse and not get you killed on the way. * -- * ... That sounds preeeetty boring!
#H-Hey! What d-do you think of my outfit?... Hehe!
It looks rad as Hell! So cool! * - * Rad? Me?
It's so cute! I love it! * ++ * R-Really!? Thank you!!!
Amazing! It's so fancy! * + * I'm so glad you like it! Hehe!
Maybe it shows just a bit too much? * -- * Eh!?

Oh! I totally saw a triclops raccoon today! They're so cute!
We should vist a demon petting zoo together! * + * AH! I-I WOULD LOVE TO!
Demon raccoons? What the Hell are those? * - * Whaaaaat? Have you never seen triclops raccoons!?
They are cute, alright? But you're much, much cuter! * ++ * EEEH!? Y-You don't mean it!!!
The animals around here are kinda odd, don't you think? * -- * NOT AT ALL! I adore all of them! How could you say that!?

It's so funny seeing those human souls screaming when being tormented!
We should torment some souls together some day! * ++ * R-REALLY!? Aww! That'd be so romantic!
It's music to my ears! * + * Such beautiful sounds! Hehe!
Maybe funny isn't the right word... * - * Eh?...
What the Hell? * -- * Eh? You don't think so?

H-Hey! Wanna go on a date with me? Hehe! J-Just kidding...
YES, I DO! * ++ * W-W-WHAT!? R-Really!? AAAAAAH!
If you want to! * + * EH!? You're not turning me down? W-Wha!?
Hahahaha! * -- * Hehe... Was it that funny?...
Do you want to or not? * - * I-I don't knooooow...

I love having so many friendsssss! They are all so precious to me.
Why do you like the attention so much? * - * Eh?... I like being social, that's all...
Why stop at being just friends? * ++ * W-WHAT!? Stahp! Why would anyone want to be more than friends with meeeee?
And I love having you as a friend! * + * Awww! You're such a cute demon friend!
Since when demons have friends? * -- * B-But... I-I thought we were friends...
